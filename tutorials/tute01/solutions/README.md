# Tutorial 1

## A. Introduction (10 minutes)

> However you want to do this is fine :) 

## B. Solving Design Problems (15 minutes)

> Any groups is fine for this activity

* In groups, your tutor is going to give you a design problem to think about and discuss.
* Come back together, and reflect with your tutor on how you came up with those answers.

> Design Problem: UNSW has decided that they want to create their own light rail, which takes students from upper campus to lower campus. Design a solution for this - how will it work? What will need to be changed about the campus layout for it to work?

## C. Hello Java and Git Revision (10 minutes)

> NOTE: You are going to need to *fork* this repo in order to add/commit/push the code, or just create another one and copy the starter code.

Your tutor is going to import the `tute01` code into VSCode and will complete the Hello World program. Things to note:

* The JDK version used (java-11-openjdk on the CSE system; possibly jdk-11 on your laptop).
* How new classes are created.
* How VSCode's autocomplete gives detailed information about the methods that can be invoked.
* Where the output appears.

> Also, give them a quick reminder of commands like `git status`, `git log`, etc.

After completing the program, your tutor will `git add`, `commit`, and `push` the changes.

> See [HelloWorld.java]

## D. Java Programming (15 minutes)

1. In the same project, write a program that uses the `Scanner` class which reads in a line of numbers separated by spaces, and sums them.

> See [ReadingInput.java]

2. Write a program that stores a message and has methods for getting the message, updating the message and printing it out in all caps. Write a `main()` method for testing this class.

> See [Shouting.java]

## E. C vs Python vs Java (10 minutes)

As a class, discuss the following questions:

1. What are some similarities and differences between C, Python and Java - stylistically, structurally but also what they are used for.

2. What is a class? What is an object? Based on your experience with Python, how are classes normally used?

> Classes: Blueprint, specifies values/fields/methods
Object: Instantiation of class, concrete values in fields

3. How do C, Python and Java compare to other languages you may have encountered at CSE or elsewhere? Is the best way of doing something in one language necessarily the best way of doing it in another?

> Things to talk about: Syntax
Classes
Access control
Type system
Memory management
Execution
Applications

4. What is an IDE?

> Integrated Development Environment
